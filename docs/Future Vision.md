From Crypto Predictions to a Generalized Multi-Agent Forecasting Protocol.

Our current application leverages a multi-agent system to forecast cryptocurrency prices, using autonomous AI agents to simulate collective human reasoning. While this serves as a focused proof-of-concept, it represents only the first step in a broader vision.

Looking forward, our goal is to generalize this forecasting protocol to support a wide range of time series prediction tasks beyond cryptocurrencies. By abstracting the multi-agent architecture, the protocol can be applied to areas such as financial markets, energy consumption, supply chain trends, or any domain where probabilistic forecasting over time is valuable.

A key aspect of this evolution is the introduction of user-defined agents. Users will be able to create or customize agents with unique strategies, heuristics, or data preferences, allowing them to influence the aggregated predictions in a controlled and transparent manner. This design enables a dynamic ecosystem where predictions are continuously refined through a combination of system-wide agents and personalized contributions.

The vision is a flexible, crowd-inspired forecasting platform, where:
- Diverse perspectives from multiple agents enhance prediction accuracy.
- Protocol abstraction allows seamless adaptation to different industries and use cases.
- User participation expands the ecosystem, fostering collaborative intelligence and tailored insights.

By building on our cryptocurrency price prediction application, we are laying the foundation for a universal multi-agent forecasting protocol â€” a system that combines the rigor of AI computation with the adaptive power of collective intelligence, poised to revolutionize how organizations and individuals approach time series forecasting.
