## Prediction Contract 
This is the contract address where premium prediction payments are processed. Before making a premium prediction, you must approve the Prediction Contract to spend the required amount of your payment tokenâ€”for example, 0.5 USD with 55% confidence. Your funds remain secure: the contract is immutable and cannot be upgraded, and your approved allowance can only be used when you initiate a prediction request. Even the contract owner cannot access your tokens.
