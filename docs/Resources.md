## Prediction Contract 
This is the contract address where the prediction payment takes place. When making an ad-hoc prediction, you must first approve the Prediction Contract to spend the required payment token amount, for example, 0.5 USD with 55% confidence. There is no need to worry about the safety of your cryptocurrency â€” this contract is immutable and cannot be upgraded. Your approved allowance can only be transferred when you actively submit a prediction request to the contract; even the contract owner has no ability to move your tokens.

## Payment Token Contract
This is the contract address of the payment token used for ad-hoc prediction fees. At the moment, we only support $USDT.
